If you pass the select values from Controller:

$recommended_foods = ["American Black Bear","Asiatic Black Bear","Brown Bear","Giant Panda"];


and In the view:

<select required="required" class="form-control" name="recommended_food">
    @foreach ($recommended_foods as $key => $food)
        <option value="{{ $food}}" {{ (old("recommended_food") == $food ? "selected":"") }}>{{ $food }}</option>
    @endforeach
</select>
